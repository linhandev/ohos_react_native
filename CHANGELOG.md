## v0.72.27
 - [breaking] added codegen support for C-API architecture (in the cli package v0.0.26). This change is breaking for RN app developers. They need to update their `harmony/entry/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` to support packages that rely on this feature by defining `RNOH_GENERATED_DIR` variable. RN app developers are expected to use the latest CLI version, because if a package is migrated before an application that depends on that package, the project won't compile. RN library developers can use codegen for C-API architecture by specifying `package.json::harmony::codegenConfig::version: 2` in their packages. The `codegenConfig` property now also supports a list of configs to allow developers to generate code for both RNOH architectures. In version 2, passing objects through a component property is not supported â€” the application won't compile. This issue may require updating `react-native`.
